Neural Network Implemented on Firm-Teacher_Clave-Direction_Classification Data Set  

The dataset is obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository, by Mehmet VurkaÃ§, Oregon Institute of Technology (current), Portland State University (where data were obtained)  
  
Following Libraries are used,  
a) Numpy  
b) Matplotlib  
c) TQDM (for progressbar during optimization)  
  
  
The code demonstrates the use of Batch Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent
